## Live Demo of Website

You can access Live Web Demo [here](https://652181baac0ed713e250cff8--admirable-twilight-b5ca40.netlify.app/). <br/>
**NOTE:** This is just a prototype, Real Web application could me more interactive and clear in term of design, lots of functionalities can be added, but for now I have developed a prototype, I can create much better than this.<br/>
**NOTE:** I have created this application from scratch, did not use any pre-built theme.
<br/><br/>
**Comments:** It was my first time working with Vue.JS, Chart.JS and ag-grid. I have learnt alot building this project. It was nice and exciting working on it and learning new technologies.

* Open terminal or vs code in that directory.
* Run following commands one by one to install dependencies and Run server.
